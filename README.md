In February 2018 **Dan Wainwright** did a quick analysis of transport data to provide context to a [story about an MP saying there was "no demand" for trains to stop at smaller stations](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-42973820). She said she "never" sees people using smaller stations, despite some of them seeing a larger growth in use than Telford's station, Telford Central.

Analysis of [data from the Office of Rail and Road](http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage-estimates) showed that passenger numbers at the five stations between Telford Central and Wolverhampton accounted for 602,952 entries and exits during 2016-17, around half as many as at Telford Central, which has a staffed ticket office and has more services calling at it (one of two hourly services to Telford misses out the other stations).
